💡 Dispenzo — Intelligent Dispensing System
Dispenzo is a smart, automated dispensing system that uses RFID authentication and weight sensors to ensure secure, precise, and controlled distribution of resources. Designed for efficiency and modularity, it is ideal for environments requiring access control and accurate dispensing.

🚀 Features
RFID-Based Access Control – Ensures only authorized users can access the system.

Real-Time Weight Monitoring – HX711 and Load Cell used for live weight tracking.

Automated Dispensing – Dispenses automatically based on commands or threshold logic.

Threshold-Based Stop Mechanism – Stops dispensing after reaching a predefined weight.

Serial Command Interface – Trigger actions via serial communication.

Calibration Memory – Calibration factor is stored in EEPROM for persistent accuracy.

Modular & Scalable – Easily customizable for other dispensing use cases.

🛠️ Hardware Used
Arduino UNO

MFRC522 RFID Module

HX711 Load Cell Amplifier

Load Cell (5kg)

Relay Module

DC Motors / Solenoid Valves

Power Supply & Breadboard

💻 Software Requirements
Arduino IDE

HX711 & MFRC522 Libraries

EEPROM Library (built-in)

⚙️ How It Works
User scans RFID card.

System verifies UID and grants access.

Command is sent to start dispensing.

Load cell measures weight in real time.

Once the threshold is reached, motors/relays are stopped automatically.
