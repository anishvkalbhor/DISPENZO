💡 Dispenzo — Intelligent Dispensing System

Dispenzo is a smart, automated dispensing system that uses RFID authentication and weight sensors to ensure secure, precise, and controlled distribution of resources. Designed for efficiency and modularity, it is ideal for environments requiring access control and accurate dispensing.

🚀 Features
- RFID-Based Access Control – Ensures only authorized users can access the system.
- Real-Time Weight Monitoring – HX711 and Load Cell used for live weight tracking.
- Automated Dispensing – Dispenses automatically based on commands or threshold logic.
- Threshold-Based Stop Mechanism – Stops dispensing after reaching a predefined weight.
- Serial Command Interface – Trigger actions via serial communication.
- Calibration Memory – Calibration factor is stored in EEPROM for persistent accuracy.
